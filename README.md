# Name_with_heart_star
To create a C program that generates a heart-shaped pattern with stars around a name, you can use the following code. This program will prompt the user for their name and then display a heart shape formed with stars along with their name in the center.

This program uses a couple of functions to create the heart shape with stars and print the name with stars on either side. It first prints the heart shape using the printHeart() function and then prints the name with stars using the printNameWithStars() function.

The program prompts the user to enter their name, reads it from standard input, and then displays the heart shape along with the name in the center surrounded by stars.

Please note that the heart shape is a simple ASCII representation and might not be perfectly symmetrical due to the limitations of using characters to form the shape.
